# Three Domain Model - Simple

These artifacts support the design of HAMR code generation for [SeL4 Microkit](https://docs.sel4.systems/projects/microkit/).  
In particular, the focus includes..
* prototyping approaches for integrating the seL4 domain scheduler in microKit to support static scheduling with strong temporal partitioning,
* prototyping HAMR generation of the [Microkit system description files](https://github.com/seL4/microkit/blob/main/docs/manual.md#system-description-file-sysdesc) from AADL and SysMLv2 architecture files
* prototyping of HAMR generation of C code for Microkit-based applications -- including header files and skeletons for protection domain entry points aligned with system description specification.

These artifacts illustrate the following newly added HAMR capabilities
* front-end processing of an [AADL model]((aadl/test_data_port_periodic_three_domains.aadl)) with model annotations derived from the previous DARPA case program
* auto-generation of [Microkit system description](microkit_initial/microkit.system) specification (which is used by the Microkit infrastructure to configure the seL4 kernel).  Specifically, the kernel is configured into partitions (Microkit protection domains) corresponding to AADL `process` components declared in the AADL model.  In addition, shared memory regions are configured to support inter-partition communication, as indicated by component data ports and connections specified in the AADL model.
* auto-generation of a [skeleton Microkit project](https://github.com/loonwerks/INSPECTA-models/tree/main/micro-examples/domain-scheduling-models/three_domain_simple/microkit_initial) including skeletons for protection domain application code for each of the `process` components declared in the AADL system.   The developer uses C development tools to complete the application code (as illustrated by a separated repo folder showing the skeleton project instantiated to a [completed system](https://github.com/loonwerks/INSPECTA-models/tree/main/micro-examples/domain-scheduling-models/three_domain_simple/microkit)).   The auto-generated project also includes makefiles, etc. to do a system build.  See the build instructions below.
* auto-generation of "infrastructure" protection domains and temporal control aspects achieved via Microkit notifications that are used to realize a static scheduling regime. 
* auto-generation of initial audit artifacts intended to support traceability/assurance of seL4 kernel configuration to models.  This is currently represented by a simple auto-generated dot diagram of [Microkernel protection domains](microkit_initial/microkit.dot).

Note that the artifacts above can also be generated by a SysMLv2 model corresponding to the AADL model.  HAMR supports that currently, but we haven't yet added a SysMLv2 model into this repo.

These aritifacts *do not* illustrate a fully realized run-time infrastructure providing AADL semantics for threading and port communication.  Such additional runtime functionality will be realized in a later prototyping step to be carried out after the basic Microkit artifacts illustrated here have been vetted.

These artifacts *do not* illustrate Rust code generation or development support.   Those features will be added later.

The rough development plan for adding these features is as follows:
* add basic support for virtual machines with Microkit protection domains (by mid-October)
* add support for AADL event and event data ports representations in the Microkit skeleton (mid-October)
* add AADL run-time code (C-based) (end of October)
* add Microkit Rust-based project skeleton (mid November)
* add AADL run-time code (Rust-based) (end of January 2025)


## AADL Architecture

AADL includes both a graphical and textual representation of models.

The graphical representation of the system (as generated by the OSATE AADL IDE) is shown below.
![arch](aadl/diagrams/arch.png)

The graphical representation above is auto-generated from [AADL Model textual representation](aadl/test_data_port_periodic_three_domains.aadl)

This system including three application components.  Each component is represented in AADL as a `thread` component within a `process` component.  This follows the AADL modeling semantics in which an AADL `process` represents a protected address space and an AADL `thread` represents a unit of schedulability.   The `process` notion aligns with a Microkit protection domain and the `thread` notion aligns with static-scheduled execution of code within a Microkit protection domain.

## Codegen
1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

1. Clone this repo and cd into the ``inspecta-models/micro-examples/domain-scheduling-model/three_domain_simple`` directory (i.e. the directory containing this readme)

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/loonwerks/INSPECTA-models.git
   cd inspecta-models/micro-examples/domain-scheduling-model/three_domain_simple
   ```

1. *OPTIONAL*

    If you want to rerun codegen then you will need to install Sireum
    and OSATE.  You can do this inside or outside of the container that you'll install in the next step (the latter is probably preferable as you could then use Sireum outside of the container).

    Copy/paste the following to install Sireum
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/sireum/kekinian.git
    kekinian/bin/build.cmd
    ```

    This installs/build Sireum from source rather than via a binary distribution (which is probably the prefered method for PROVERS).  

    Now set ``SIREUM_HOME`` to point to where you cloned kekinian and add ``$SIREUM_HOME/bin`` to your path.  E.g. for bash

    ```
    echo "export SIREUM_HOME=$(pwd)/kekinian" >> $HOME/.bashrc
    echo "export PATH=\$SIREUM_HOME/bin:\$PATH" >> $HOME/.bashrc
    source $HOME/.bashrc
    ```

    Now install OSATE and the Sireum OSATE plugins into your current directory (or wherever as indicated via the ``-o`` option).  For Windows/Linux 

    ```
    sireum hamr phantom -u -v -o $(pwd)/osate
    ```

    or for Mac copy/paste
    ```
    sireum hamr phantom -u -v -o $(pwd)/osate.app
    ```

    Now set ``OSATE_HOME`` to point to where you installed Osate

    ```
    echo "export OSATE_HOME=$(pwd)/osate" >> $HOME/.bashrc
    source $HOME/.bashrc
    ```

1. Download and run the Microkit docker container, mounting the ``inspecta-models/micro-examples/domain-scheduling-model/three_domain_simple`` directory into

   ```
   docker run -it -w /root -v $(pwd):/root/three_domain_simple jasonbelt/microkit_domain_scheduling
   ```

   This container includes customized versions of Microkit and seL4 that support domain scheduling.  They were built off the following pull requests

   - [microkit #175](https://github.com/seL4/microkit/pull/175)
   - [seL4 #1308](https://github.com/seL4/seL4/pull/1308)

1. *OPTIONAL* Rerun codegen
   
    Launch the Slash script [aadl/bin/run-hamr.cmd](aadl/bin/run-hamr.cmd) from the command line.  This runs codegen on [top.impl](aadl/test_data_port_periodic_three_domains.aadl#L138) via OSATE and targets the Microkit platform.

   ```
   aadl/bin/run-hamr.cmd
   ```

1. Build and simulate the image

    Inside the container do the following

    ```
    export MICROKIT_BOARD=qemu_virt_aarch64
    export MICROKIT_SDK=/root/microkit/release/microkit-sdk-1.4.1-dev.14+cf88629
    cd /root/three_domain_simple/microkit
    make qemu
    ```

    You should get output similar to

    ```
