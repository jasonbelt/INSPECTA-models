# Firewall-Simple

Mock-up of open platform firewall component in Slang to prototype contract verification concepts.

(TBD - documentation for running and verifying)


## Open Issues

- Need a formal definition "well-formed" / "mal-formed" notion that is mentioned in the requirements
- Typo in HLR6 - If the firewall gets an ARP packet frame from RxIn, the firewall shall copy that frame to TxOut.
   (Should be "RxOut")
