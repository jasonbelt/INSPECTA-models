# GUMBO System Verification Prototyping

This directory holds files being used to *prototype compositional reasoning 
principles for HAMR-built systems*.  The goal of this prototyping is to 
develop a framework that uses extensions to GUMBO component contract language
to support system verification and testing.

The folder currently includes a collection of Slang scripts that
illustrate the abstract behavior of HAMR-generated AADL-based systems,
along with some of the deductive principles used for reasoning about 
HAMR systems.  The files also illustrate different concepts of Logika's unfolding analysis and 
how it can be applied to HAMR-based systems
